# Roving Lily 漂流百合
*Where roving lily travels, where it take roots.*

This is a blockchain-based BBS, built on Substrate. It is a course project of 24Fall Blockchain Technology Practice in NJU.


Proposal: [Roving Lily](https://jackcui.notion.site/rovinglily)

> It is just a course proj (at least so far), and it severely untested. You should always obey the laws of the country or domain you are in. The author do not take any responsibility for any abuse of this software.


# Use
Now it is only a demo running on local machine. You can run it by:
```bash
cd rovinglily-chain
cargo build --release
./target/release/solochain-template-node --dev
```
> You can find that I even did not change the name of the template qwq.

You can connect it to polkadot.js.org/apps to monitor the chain.

```bash
cd ui
npm start
